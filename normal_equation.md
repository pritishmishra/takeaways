- Gradient descent was one way of minimizing the cost function and predicting values.
- However, that involves running through iterations (sometimes a lot) before arriving at the minimized values.
- Lets see how we can analytically solve and determine the minimized values.

Using this method. we try to find the inverse of matrices and sometimes might encounter cases of non-invertibility of matrices.
