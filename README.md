## Partial Response & Partial Update
- [Making APIs Faster: Introducing Partial Response and Partial Update](http://googlecode.blogspot.de/2010/03/making-apis-faster-introducing-partial.html)
- Conceptualizing the API as a database. A database can handle incredible variability in requests through SQL. The API should also be able to answer questions with the same degree of variability that SQL can for a database. e.g. [YQL](https://developer.yahoo.com/yql/)

# P.S.:
- ## What are Chatty APIs?
  - [Addressing “chattiness” in a REST API](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18900741/addressing-chattiness-in-a-rest-api)
- ## CAP Theorem
  - The CAP Theorem states that in the presence of a network partition, one has to choose between consistency[a] and availability[b].
  - 1. Consistency: Every read receives the most recent write or an error.
  - 2. Availability: Every request receives a (non-error) response – without guarantee that it contains the most recent write
